## Component Design

Design a reusable Angular Dialog component

**Requirement: resuable, flexible**

`Title` area only display "Text" information.

`X` close button can dismiss the Dialog component.

In **Content area** should be able to display any **text, form, different custom components**.
Can close the dialog by **clicking X button** or **any custom button can trigger close event (for example, if you pass a form to the Content, when click `Submit` button should close the Dialog)**.

  ---------------------------
  |                         |
  | <Title>              X  |
  ---------------------------
  |                         |
  |                         |
  | <Content>               |
  |                         |
  |                         |
  |-------------------------|

You can use Angular CLI or [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) to create an Angular project.

1. Create `Dialog` component folder, all Dialog releated code should be inside this folder. âœ… 
2. In `app.component.ts`, use `Dialog` component that you created with few example to show how to use your component (don't use any existing implementation such as Angular Material) âœ…
3. Styling is **not** important, you don't need to make it looks beautiful, background overlay is not required. âœ… **I did it anyway, clicking on the overlay will also close the dialog**
4. We mainly would like to see how you design a reusable component. âœ… 
5. Basic unit testing cases for `Dialog` Component are **required**. âœ… 
6. It is **not** necessary to implement ARIA / Keyboard focus, you can skip it and it won't affect the score. Of course, it is a **plus** to show us your knowledge about accessibility. ðŸ¤ž **I have tried to add some aria attributes to the dialog component**
